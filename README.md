This repository contains the code and configuration files for my Automated Data Pipeline for Sales Data in GCP project. This project involves the integration of several GCP services to create an efficient, automated data pipeline for sales data, including the following:

1. Developed a web portal using Python Flask for shop owners to upload sales data files (CSV, Excel).
2. Stored the uploaded files in a Google Cloud Storage bucket. Implemented ETL process to import the data from the upload portal and integrate with the data warehouse to load the processed data. 
3. Triggered Google Cloud Function to process and load the data into BigQuery for analysis purposes.
